Past measurements of the 2^3P-5D lines we observed were accurate to 140-200MHz and were 13GHz away from present theory. We improve the accuracy by an order of magnitude and find that our measurements agree with current predictions within our systematic error budget.

High-order QED corrections to the Helium spectrum are the strongest for low-lying S states (and the experimental uncertainty is greatest for the ground state also).

## Energy level predictions

From Drake's email:
	"The main significance of your work will likely be a determination of the absolute ionization energy of the 3 3S and 5 3S states to a sub-MHz accuracy where the theoretical uncertainties are much larger due to the QED terms."
	Sadly, we do not achieve such small uncertainty. 

Wienczek, Quantum electrodynamic corrections to the 1s3d states of the helium atom
	Increasing precision of spectroscopic measurements of Helium are pushing the limits required to test fundamental theories of physics and determine physical constants. 
	Namely, the 2^3P1-2^3P2 transition to 25kHz determines the fine structure constant to parts-per-billion and the 2^3P-2^3S to 1.4kHz, which can determine the nuclear charge radius to below 0.1%, better than muonic helium Lamb shift. In the former case, the bottleneck is that theory is not sufficiently developed!
	Measured 2L-3D intervals are about 1MHz larger than theory.


Morton and Drake
	"Unfortunately there is no precision laboratory data involving 3^3S1, 4^1S0, or 5^1S0"
	Opportunities for future investigations:
	* Improved determination of the 2^1P1 and 2^1S0 levels relative to others in 4He
	* An accurate measurement of the isotope shift of 2^1S0-2^1P1
	* The ionization potential of both isotopes is unknown by possibly 60MHz! Additional measurements are needed for the ground-state separation :(
	
	

Morton & Drake again:
	Presently there is a 33MHz uncertainty in the ground state ionization potential. Most of this comes from uncertainty in the 1s-2s transitions.
	The greatest error in predicted energy levels are for the 1^1S0, 3^1S0, 3^3S1,4^1S0,4^3S1,5^1S0,5^3S1.
	There is a 350kHz uncertainty in the prediction of the 5^3S_1 energy level.

Wiese and Fuhr
	"In contrast to these high-precision calculations—and some
	similar smaller, slightly less refined theoretical works—
	experimental results have played only a minor role for this
	compilation, essentially serving to reaffirm the calculations"

## Isotope shifts


Patkos, Higher-order recoil corrections for singlet states of the Helium atom
	Measured 2^3S-2^3P and 2^3S-2^1S transitions give different isotope shifts, which give disparate predictions for the nuclear charge radii in He3 and He4
	The authors find a four-sigma disagreement between their prediction of the difference-of-squares of the nuclear radii and the measured values. There are two results for the 2^3P-2^3S transition which differ slightly from each other but significantly from the 2^1S-2^3S transition, (1.069(3) and 1.061(3) fm, and 1.027(11) fm, respectively.) 

Morton and Drake
	* The only serious disagreements with theory involve the 3^3D and 3^1D levels of 3He...
