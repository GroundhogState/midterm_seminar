Li-Yan's notes on the He* tuneout

### Authors:

## Purpose

Explain what problem they are solving, or what information they were trying to gain

## Context

Briefly summarise the background of the problem they are solving and why it is important area

## Approach

Describe the method they use to complete their work, i.e. the experimental system and measurements, the model design and computational techniques used, or the setup of their equations and the assumptions applied.

## Contribution

Describe their results and conclusions, assess how they fit into the field

## Relevance

Drake and Martin [1 herein] fixed the ionization energies of:
2 3S1, 2 1S0, 2 3P2,1,0 , 2 1P1, 3 1S0, 3 3P2,1,0, 3 1P1, 4 3S1, and 5 3S1

For us, this fixes 2^3P2 as a pumped ground state, and the 5^3S1 gap could have helped us pin down the WM error were it not so close to our reference anyway... :(

"Unfortunately there is no precision laboratory data involving 3^3S1, 4^1S0, or 5^1S0" - where are these?

Opportunities for future investigations:
* Improved determination of the 2^1P1 and 2^1S0 levels relative to others in 4He
* An accurate measurement of the isotope shift of 2^1S0-2^1P1
* The ionization potential of both isotopes is unknown by possibly 60MHz! Additional measurements are needed for the ground-state separation :(
* The only serious disagreements with theory involve the 3^3D and 3^1D levels of 3He...
Dang, we can't do these. 

## Quality

Discuss the quality of the writing and presentation of results, and try to assess how much you trust their assumptions, approach and conclusions
