## Purpose

Explain what problem they are solving, or what information they were trying to gain

## Context

Briefly summarise the background of the problem they are solving and why it is important area

## Approach

Super old-school; LN2-cooled discharge lamps shone through a window in the dewar to a vacuum chamber with a photographic plate, whose fringe separation is measured with a ruler relative to mercury standards!

## Contribution

Observation of the 2^3P-5^3D and 2^P-5^3S transitions currently quoted in NIST, could not distinguish the lines and precise to  7sf.  
Observation of the 2^1P1 to 5^1D2 line and the 2P-4D and 2P-4S spin-parity preserving lines
Best overall is 7sf precision, we can beat by two orders of magnitude

## Relevance

The current NIST source for 23 (!) Helium lines which we could in principle blow out by a couple orders of magnitude. 

## Quality

Discuss the quality of the writing and presentation of results, and try to assess how much you trust their assumptions, approach and conclusions
