## Purpose

Measured 2^3S-2^3P and 2^3S-2^1S transitions give different isotope shifts, which give disparate predictions for the nuclear charge radii in He3 and He4. This theory paper corroborates this, and demands further investigation.

## Context

The most famous manifestation of the proton radius puzzle is the disagreement between the proton radii obtained from the Lamb shift in electronic and muonic hydrogen. In this paper, the authors examine the aforementioned disagreement in isotope shift and examine 'all significant theoretical contributions' (what are they missing? QCD, likely...). The previous theoretical value could have missed an 8.8kHz correction to the 2^1S transition (or a less-probable 49.7kHz correction to the 2^3P transition), but this paper fails to find such a missing contribution.

## Approach

Lots and lots of math.

## Contribution

The authors find a four-sigma disagreement between their prediction of the difference-of-squares of the nuclear radii and the measured values. There are two results for the 2^3P-2^3S transition which differ slightly from each other but significantly from the 2^1S-2^3S transition, (1.069(3) and 1.061(3) fm, and 1.027(11) fm, respectively.)
