## Purpose

Explain what problem they are solving, or what information they were trying to gain

## Context

Possible resolutions of the proton radius puzzle include non-universality in lepton-hadron interactions or incorrect values of fundamental constants. There are hints from hydrogen expts that the rydberg constant could be wrong, but would need considerable corroboration. 
The more conservative (maybe) solution is that the electron and muon coupling constants are not identical. This could be corroborated by precision measurements in Helium; at the moment, present theory is only sufficient to predict the difference in radii in 4He and 3He, but this paper shows that the next order in m alpha^7 QED correction would be sufficient to determine nuclear charge radii to within 1%, to provide a test of lepton universality with present (?) experimental data. 

## Approach

Describe the method they use to complete their work, i.e. the experimental system and measurements, the model design and computational techniques used, or the setup of their equations and the assumptions applied.

## Contribution

Describe their results and conclusions, assess how they fit into the field

## Relevance

They give very precise values for the splitting of the 2^3P states, which is possibly very handy. 
Discovery of the discrepancy in nuclear charge radii differences; call for another measurement of the 2^3S-2^1S interval, of which only one has been reported (by Vassen's group)

## Quality

Discuss the quality of the writing and presentation of results, and try to assess how much you trust their assumptions, approach and conclusions
