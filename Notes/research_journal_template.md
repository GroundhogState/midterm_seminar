## Purpose

This paper tabulates the most precise, to date, theoretical and experimental determinations of 4He I energy levels as a reference.

## Context

Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe, so a readily-available resource for its spectral properties is essential. This isotope is the most naturally abundant.

## Approach

Describe the method they use to complete their work, i.e. the experimental system and measurements, the model design and computational techniques used, or the setup of their equations and the assumptions applied.

## Contribution

Describe their results and conclusions, assess how they fit into the field

## Relevance

Explain how this paper is relevant to your project and what you are trying to get out of the paper. Does it suggest other papers you should read, or give you new information you need?

## Quality

Discuss the quality of the writing and presentation of results, and try to assess how much you trust their assumptions, approach and conclusions

## Misc

Note that they drop the bulk of the term symbols, namely the 1s and parity symbols (the 1s3p for example)
