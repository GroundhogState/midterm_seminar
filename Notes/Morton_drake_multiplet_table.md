## Purpose

This paper tabulates the most precise, to date, theoretical and experimental determinations of 4He I energy levels as a reference.

## Context

Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe, so a readily-available resource for its spectral properties is essential. This isotope is the most naturally abundant.

## Approach

Describe the method they use to complete their work, i.e. the experimental system and measurements, the model design and computational techniques used, or the setup of their equations and the assumptions applied.

## Contribution

Aside from providing energy gaps and strengths from which we can estimate expected transition frequencies, this paper lists the known energy levels. Notably, this list does not include the 4- or 5- level singlet states, but does include the 5^3S1. There is an uncertainty of 33MHz in the ground state ionization potential. 

The greatest error in predicted energy levels are for the 1^1S0, 3^1S0, 3^3S1,4^1S0,4^3S1,5^1S0,5^3S1. The latter has a wavelength uncertainty of .000002 angstrom.



## Relevance



## Quality

Discuss the quality of the writing and presentation of results, and try to assess how much you trust their assumptions, approach and conclusions

## Misc

Note that they drop the bulk of the term symbols, namely the 1s and parity symbols (the 1s3p for example)
