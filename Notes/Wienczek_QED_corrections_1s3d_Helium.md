## Purpose

Explain what problem they are solving, or what information they were trying to gain

## Context

Increasing precision of spectroscopic measurements of Helium are pushing the limits required to test fundamental theories of physics and determine physical constants. 
Namely, the 2^3P1-2^3P2 transition to 25kHz determines the fine structure to parts-per-billion and the 2^3P-2^3S to 1.4kHz, which can determine the nuclear charge radius to below .1%, better than muonic helium Lamb shift.The bottleneck is that theory is not sufficiently developed!

## Approach

Describe the method they use to complete their work, i.e. the experimental system and measurements, the model design and computational techniques used, or the setup of their equations and the assumptions applied.

## Contribution

The authors compute the ionization energies of the 1s3d states of He4 by extending to higher-order effects in QED.

## Relevance

This paper refers to [5], which points out the that measured transitions involving 3D states are in disagreement with predictions. It also discusses the tests of QED now achievable with Helium spectroscopy. In the conclusion, there is a comment that all measured 2L-2L' transitions agree well with theory, but the measured 2L-3D intervals are about 1MHz larger than theory. This would imply an unknown contribution to the n=2 ionization energies, and therefore corrections of 10/n^3 to arbitrary states. 
In table VII, comparison between theory and experiment are given for the 3D-2L transitions that have been measured to sub-MHz. 

## Quality

Discuss the quality of the writing and presentation of results, and try to assess how much you trust their assumptions, approach and conclusions
