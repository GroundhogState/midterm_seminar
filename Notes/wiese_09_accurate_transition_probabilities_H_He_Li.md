## Purpose

Exactly what it says on the tin.

## Context

On Drake's calculations of the HeI lines:
"In contrast to these high-precision calculations—and some
similar smaller, slightly less refined theoretical works—
experimental results have played only a minor role for this
compilation, essentially serving to reaffirm the calculations"

## Approach

Describe the method they use to complete their work, i.e. the experimental system and measurements, the model design and computational techniques used, or the setup of their equations and the assumptions applied.

## Contribution

Describe their results and conclusions, assess how they fit into the field

## Relevance

Explain how this paper is relevant to your project and what you are trying to get out of the paper. Does it suggest other papers you should read, or give you new information you need?

## Quality

Discuss the quality of the writing and presentation of results, and try to assess how much you trust their assumptions, approach and conclusions
