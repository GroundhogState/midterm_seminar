Helium: named after Helios
Discovered in solar eclipse by Herschel's team and could not be identified with known spectra
	 $1s2p ^3P \rightarrow 1s3d 1D \& 3D$ probably blurring of both
Second most abundant element in the universe, 23 percent of baryonic mass mostly from the first 3 mins of universe.
Major fusion product in the elementary forge of the sun, and critical ingredient in forming Carbon-6, essential for life as we know it.
On earth, vanishingly rare; some 5ppm in atmo

Of course, there are two stable isotopes of helium; fermionic helium 3, and bosonic helium 4. Their spectra differ, but the fun really starts when we move to the other end of the Kelvin scale, near absolute zero, where helium 4 forms a bose-einstein condensate.

### Cold atom intro

###

Today I'll be talking to you about some recent work by The Helium BEC group, which I hope will illustrate the wealth of problems one can tackle in the ultracold regime. I'll be talking specifically about works that I've been closely involved with, namely two recent ventures into atomic spectroscopy and two works that look beyond single-atom physics into weak and strongly interacting systems, respectively.

So obviously a BEC is a very unusual state of matter - indeed they were only observed in 1995, 70-odd years after they were first described theoretically. The first question one might have is how one actually gets anywhere near absolute zero - and to answer that I'll talk you through the anatomy of a BEC factory. 

This is a schematic of our experiment, which looks kind of forbidding but we'll break it down piece by piece. The bulk of the device is the vacuum chamber, which thanks to a half-dozen turbomolecular pumps is evacuated to about a trillionth of an atmosphere in the science chamber. The pressure is considerably higher in the hot end which houses the plasma discharge source we use to produce Helium in the metastable excited state, which I'll return to shortly. The helium gas expands through a skimming nozzle creating a wide beam, which is collimated and slowed by several stages of laser cooling before capture in a magneto-optical trap. Then, we use a faint beam to kick atoms through a differential pumping stage into the second MOT in the science chamber, where the pressure is low enough to transfer the helium to a magnetic trap and achieve BEC by forced evaporative cooling. We have various devices with which we interrogate the atoms, and then observe their response after they freefall for 350 ms onto our detector. But that's a lot to take in, so let's break that down.

### Laser cooling

Doppler cooling does a great deal of work for us, and the mechanism is alarmingly simple. Consider a two-level atom with some velocity in the laboratory frame. Now suppose there are two oppositely directed lasers, each tuned red, or lower frequency, of the natural transition by some gap Delta. Now, in the atom's reference frame, these beams will be Doppler shifted, and the beam propagating opposite to the atom's motion will be blue-shifted, perhaps enough that the doppler shift little delta is enough to bring the beam back into resonance. The atom absorbs a photon, and thereby a momentum impulse opposite to its motion, slowing it down. If the upper state lifetime is short enough, it will scatter many times before walking out of the beam, each decay giving a kick in a random direction, which over many scattering event averages to zero. This process can neither confine atoms nor, in general, cool them to the ground state, but is instead limited because the linewidth of the atomic transition eventually renders small velocity differences indistinguishable; this is the Doppler limit, which for helium is about 1mK. The first stage of cooling in our experiment is a 2D atomic beam collimation stage, which employs 2D Doppler cooling, before loading into a magneto-optical trap. 

\

So why Helium? 
Helium's ground state is nearly 20 eV away from the rest of the electronic states, which makes it inaccessible by modern laser technology. However, the 2^3S1 state is doubly forbidden to decay to the ground state, so is endowed with an extraordinarily long lifetime of 7xxx seconds - more than enough for the experiments I'll talk about today.

## Intro
>> UPDATE J IN LEVEL DIAGRAM

Helium is the second-most abundant element in the known universe, comprising 23 percent of baryone mass, most of which produced in nucleosynthesis, three minutes after the big bang. Helium is a major product of stellar fusion, and takes its name from the greek sun titan Helios as it was first detected by observation of a 587nm line during a solar eclipse which could not be identified with any other known elements. Back on earth, Helium comprises only 20ppm of the atmosphere, as it is light enough to float through the stratosphere and escape into space. The founder of our school, Mark Oliphant, was part of the team that first identified Helium-3 by mass-to-charge ratio separation from the tritium nucleus. In fact, Helium has two stable isotopes, the fermionic helium 3 and the bosonic helium 4. In the furnace of the sun, spin certainly has thermodynamic consequences, but on the other end of the temperature scale, near absolute zero, the importance of spin becomes readily apparent. Helium-4, a boson, is not bound by the exclusion principle and so many bosons can occupy the same quantum state. When a large fraction of a bosonic gas condenses into the ground state of the confining potential, the resulting phase of matter is called a Bose-Einstein condensate. This image depicts the process of condensation, with a notable population of the zero-momentum mode coexisting with a thermal background at a few hundred microkelvin, eventually subsuming most of the gas at ultralow temperatures. Bose-Einstein condensates, or BEC, are named for Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein, both credited for their prediction some 70 years before the state was produced in a lab.

The first elements condensed were the alkali atoms Sodium and Potassium, and now a whole zoo of elements have been cooled to degeneracy, both bosons and fermions, all with their advantages and drawbacks. Helium is presently the only noble gas to have been condensed, and it's likely to remain that way. Since the first BEC in 1995, the field has flourished into a global industry, and we'll take a peek at elements of the cutting edge along the way today.

Of course, we're here in Canberra, where I've been working in the Helium BEC group for the last three years. We're a very collaborative group, with many hands on each project, so I'll tell you about the works in which I've been substantially involved. 
But sure, you may say, BECs are pretty cool, but what are they actually good for? I'll give you three reasons now and expand upon them shortly.
First, Given their exquisite isolation, they provide pristine conditions to realize ideal conditions for tests of fundamental theories.
Second, BECs let us routinely distil extensive coherence in large systems, clearing paths into the study of macroscopic coherence as in superfluids and superconductors.
Third, the precision engineering of many-body quantum states requires vanishing entropy in the initial state, readily found near absolute zero. 

So now you want a BEC, let's find talk about how to make one. 

Here's an anatomical diagram of our BEC machine. We feed garden-variety Helium-4 in at room temperature, through a liquid-nitrogen cooled plasma discharge chamber, and through a skimming nozzle to produce a Helium beam with mean velocity about 700 metres per second. We use laser cooling to collimate and slow the beam to X metres per second, loading a magneto-optical trap at at the end of the beamline. We use a faint laser to nudge a low-velocity beam through another differential pumping stage at the back of the MOT, loading a second MOT in the science chamber. Here, the background pressure is about one billionth of an atmosphere, ensuring a low enough background collision rate for a long-lived magnetic trap, wherein radio-forced evaporative cooling reduces the rms velocity to some mm/s, and the remaining gas crosses the BEC threshold at a few hundred microkelvin. Our multi-channel plate delay-line detector, which sits a 350ms freefall away from the science chamber, and is what makes all this work worthwhile.

Helium wields a double-edged sword - a 20eV gap separation between its ground and lowest excited state. This makes it inaccessible to modern lasers, but is redeemed by the two-hour lifetime of the metastable 2^3S_1 state, which is doubly forbidden to decay to the ground state, and opens up an opportune laser cooling transition at the micron scale. 

This gap also allows us to employ detectors typically used in much higher energy experiments. The 20eV gap liberates a handful of electrons from the skin of one of the array of pores on the face of the multi-channel plate. These electrons are accelerated by a 2kV potential down an electron-multiplying channel, amplifying single-atom incidences by a factor of about a million, creating picosecond (?) pulses in the delay-line. A software correlator turns pulse arrival times at each terminal into time and position measurements, giving us full 3D sampling of the far-field momentum distribution with single-atom sensitivity, unavailable to any other condensed species. 

So now you've got a BEC. What do you want to do with it?


## Metrology I: Spectroscopy

How about some good old-fashioned spectroscopy?

Arguably, spectroscopy is the mother of all our understanding of matter. From spectroscopy was born the Bohr model, the Pauli principle, and Dirac's prediction of antimatter. For all its triumphs, our best physical theory, quantum electrodynamics, falls short in some high-precision instances. For example, if you switch the electron in Hydrogen for a Muon and measure the respective Lamb shifts (?), you can determine the radius of the proton and find that it's different in each case. We need more measurements to constrain or discard competing theories. Fortunately, the simplicity of Helium allows predictions of energy levels to kHz in hundreds of THz, accurate enough to compete with modern spectroscopy. 

So of all the lines in Helium, which are the most informative to measure? Being diligent scientists, we take reproduction of measurements seriously, and so existing points of difference between theory and data are natural touchpoints - and this guides us to the 2L-5D transitions, which differ at the scale of a few MHz. Precision measurements of the spin-flipping transitions also disagree by a few MHz, which bears further investigation. More egregious is that the NIST database lists measurements of transitions from the 2^3P to 5^3D and 5^3S states that differ from theory at about thirteen gigahertz. So the upper state of our cooling transition is now our lower state of interest, so now we need to pump to the 2^3P state, probe in the 400nm range, and detect incredibly weak transitions as in the singlet-triplet manifold. How? Well, neat tricks with BECs, of course. 
>> QED effects and theoretical uncertainty

An essential stage in BEC production is evaporative cooling, which drives temperature down at the expense of atom number, but nonetheless acts as a phase space amplifiier which is highly sensitive to the initial phase space density. Reaching BEC or not is a matter of a factor order 1 in phase space density, so perturbations to the initial state can be make or break. Key to the condensation of Helium is an optical cooling stage which precedes evaporative cooling, which gives us an opportune time to apply the blue probe beam and look for symptoms of heating by resonant photon scattering. Evaporative cooling works by driving a resonance between trapped and untrapped states from an ellipsoidal shell around the trap centre with a fixed Zeeman splitting from the confining field. Energetic atoms near the tails of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution are thus removed, and elastic collisions drive the rethermalization of the cloud at a reduced temperature. Drawing this so-called RF knife closer to the minimum splitting gradually lowers the average energy of the trapped atoms, cooling the sample across the condenstation threshold. The RF frequency at the end of the process fixes an upper limit to the energy of the atoms, hence the BEC temperature, and so changes in phase space density (d) are transduced into changes in atom number (D), which is of course the business of metastable helium. We apply broadband radio pulses to release some 0.5% of the trapped atoms uniformly across the magnetic trap, which gives us a low-intensity pulsed atom laser whose flux we integrate to obtain a total atom number.
>> VARIABLE MAGNETIC FIELD

I implemented this method with a super-cool externally doubled tunable titanium sapphire laser which was generously loaned to us by Chris Vale's group at Swinburne uni. We use a software laser lock with respect to to a High-Finesse WS8 wavemeter, calibrated periodically with a two-photon transition in a Cesium cell. The intensity of the light is regulated by an AOM and the polarization is set with waveplates at the window into the vacuum chamber, where the beam illuminates the BEC - threading the eye of a ten micron needle in the dark with a half-meter lever. 

This is a graph I'm pretty proud of - the first measurement of a transition that addresses two points of contention - the 2L-5D interval and the singlet-triplet gap. This is the weakest of the transitions we measured (N?), and even with a predicted oscillator strength of (?) we have a SNR of (?). The horizontal shows the frequency difference from the zero-field prediction, and the two curves show the measured change in atom number versus frequency for two magnetic field strengths. We obtain the centre frequency from the Lorentzian fit, and note that the fitted linewidths are below the predicted Doppler broadening of the lower state. Orange bars show the predicted centres including error in magnetic field calibration, which differ by a few MHz.

For completeness, these are all the transitions we measured. The last measurement of the 2^3P-5^3D gap could not resolve the fine structure splitting, about 300MHz, but here we clearly see each of the transitions, notwithstanding some overlap in the D_2 and D_3 intervals by unfortunate choice of magnetic field.

Our measurement at two independently calibrated field strengths and narrow spectral resolution give us a statistical error below a MHz, fixing these transitions to some parts per billion, with MHz differences from theory. But, our ultimate accuracy is limited by the wavemeter to 20MHz in the worst case, or 4MHz when close enough to the calibration line. Still, we correct the previous values by thirteen gigahertz, and update five values in the NIST database. Unfortunately, we don't have the precision required to compete with the state of the art, but had we a frequency comb reference then we'd be in the game for tests of fundamental physics. To give credit where credit is due, the last measurement of these transitions used a discharge cell submerged in liquid nitrogen, passed through a window to an in-vacuum diffraction grating and illuminating a phosphor screen with lines whose splitting was measured with a ruler against a Mercury reference. Still, they were patently wrong, and we conclude that within our experimental uncertainty, QED is correct.


## Metrology II: Tuneout

But I promised you tests of QED, so let's talk about the campaign we're wrapping up for a precision measurement of the 413nm tuneout wavelength in Helium.

Tuneout wavelengths are those for which an atom is completely ignorant of the AC electric field. They're a consequence of competing level shifts, so let's build that up for a refresher. The level spacing of a two-level atom expands when exposed to a coherent field which is red relative to the natural splitting. Conversely, a blue-detuned light field compresses the level splitting. Atoms in the ground state feel a force equal to the intensity gradient multiplied by the frequency-dependent polarizability, drawing them to maxima in the red-detuned case, and minima in the blue-detuned case. This is the dipole force, the basis of the optical tweezer. The polarizability of a multi-level atom therefore is dependent on many simultaneous level shifts, and the tuneout wavelengths for a given ground state are those at which all of these shifts exactly cancel, rendering the atoms completely blind to radiation at that frequency. Thanks to Helium's structural simplicity, these wavelengths can be predicted with X accuracy, including high-order corrections for effects of QED, therefore a measurement of a Tuneout in Helium provides a stringent, absolute constraint.

It's been said that frequency begets the finest measurement, so as budding metrologists we used another new spectroscopic technique to find the zero crossing in the resonance shift of the impulse response function of a magnetically trapped BEC perturbed by a variable laser frequency. With no applied light, the BEC oscillates in a harmonic magnetic potential, forming a reference clock that we beat against that of a combined laser and magnetic trap, to determine where the clock shift vanishes. Red of the tuneout, the polarizability is negative, hence the optical potential is repulsive, reducing the effective spring constant of the trap and lowering the oscillation frequency. For a laser blue of the tuneout the polarizability is positive, hence increasing the spring constant and the resulting trap frequency.
>> SWITCH POTENTIALS; CHECK COLOURS

Again, we employ a pulsed atom laser, this time after an impulse applied by a magnetic field gradient, and recover the in-trap oscillation frequency with a sinusoidal fit to the BEC displacement on our detector. Scanning the laser frequency through the region of the tuneout and comparing to laser-free calibration stable to 18mHz we interpolate to find the zero crossing of the trap frequency shift with respect to laser wavelength.
>> UNITS ON GRAPH

With zero-crossing uncertainties on the order of 100MHz(?) we are able to resolve the dependence of the tuneout on the polarization of the input light, which is shown here by plotting the fitted tuneout from various scans as a function of two Stokes parameters which specify the polarization of light in the atom's frame. Fitting our data to a multiparameter function on the sphere allows us to specify linear combinations of the scalar, vector, and tensor polarizabilities, fixing a value for the tuneout wavelength that...
You'll learn all about at Bryce's final seminar, when we're done with our analysis.


## Many-body physics I: Quantum Depletion

Moving away from the world of atomic physics, another major research area of BECs is the study of extensive coherent phenomena like superfluidity and superconductivity. While all BECs are superfluids, but not all of a superfluid is condensate - the particle density in a superfluid is some 10^X times greater than in our BECs, which are about one ten thousanth of atmospheric density, so inter-atomic interactions force occupation of momentum modes other than the ground state, which is known as the quantum depletion of a condensate. 
In more detail, to make the physics of condensates more tractable, a common approximation is to replace the state vector with a complex field whose amplitude squared is the ground-state density, and whose phase is fixed after breaking the U(1) symmetry when crossing the BEC transition. This cannot be a complete picture of a condensate, because it implies a zero-entropy state which is forbidden by the second law of thermodynamics. In fact, a condensate always coexists with a population of thermal atoms, and even an ideal stationary condensate has a quasiparticle spectrum described by the Bogoliubov theory, which like all spectra is subject to quantum fluctuations. These fluctuations are described by a density-dependent quantum correction to the mean-field wavefunction, and their population scales with the dimensionless gas parameter which characterizes the importance of interactions, increasing with density and interparticle scattering length.

This is another context where metastable Helium shines - here's a section of the momentum profile of a condensate, which clearly shows the central peak of the condensed fraction, the thermal distribution of the non-condensed fraction, and the asymptotic power-law scaling of momentum density as predicted by Bogoliubov theory. The sticking point, though, is the reasonable-sounding argument that because the depleted population scales with density, and the free expansion of a falling BEC is adiabatic, the depleted population should vanish in the far-field, and yet here it is apparently as clear as day. So, this isn't our data, but from another Helium group in France, and when we found this paper, we went downstairs to reproduce their results and had data rolling in by the end of the week.

A quick caveat, though, is that we've otherwise got a pretty good handle on depletion, at least in-trap. Here are two graphs from past works showing great agreement between the predicted amount of quanutm depletion and, on the left, the depth an optical lattice potential which mediates the gas parameter by forcing up the particle density, and on the right in a homogeneous condensate whose scattering length was controlled with a Feshbach resonance. So the contention seems to be somewhere in the non-equilibrium dynamics of expanding superfluids - buzzword central!

The experiment in France resolved the momentum profile by dropping BECs straight onto their detector, varying the condensate density by changing the trapping frequency of their optical dipole trap, and by fitting a power law to the observed depleted region they extract the scaling coefficient as a function of density. Notice that their observed dependence is six times stronger than the otherwise successful Bogolibov theory, which raises some thorny questions. So what do we see? By repeating the experiment we also resolve a depleted population, so that's one point of consistency. However, our dependence is much weaker. Puzzling. Last year, I stopped over in France and knocked on their door to ask what's up. I learned that since publishing their findings in PRL, they'd determined that their BECs weren't perfectly spin-polarized. Because our trap is magnetic, by definition we can only trap one magnetic state of the metastable state, with angular momentum quantum number 1, whereas their optical potential can trap a mixture of spin states. After correcting this defect in their experiment, they'd found that the depleted population is still visible, but with a dependence only 1.7 times stronger than theory - right in the realm of our results. 

So there's consistend divergence of theory and experiment, which means there's more to be understood. This case isn't resolved yet, and it's one of the questions left to answer in my PhD.

## Many-body physics II: Optical Lattices

Our final leap this afternoon is from the weakly to the strongly interacting regime, towards quantum state engineering and the state of the art of ultracold atom systems: An optical lattice for quantum simulation.

Broadly speaking, quantum physics is hard because only a handful of models are exactly solvable, and because the state space grows exponentially with the number of subsystems. Therefore, if we want to get a handle on large quantum states for applications in sensing, metamaterials, or computing, we need a way around this obstruction. The posterchild for solutions to this problem are quantum computers, but in the arms race for computational advantage, classical computers don't look like they're about to give up the ghost just yet. However, the capability of so-called quantum simulators, or controllable quantum systems that directly realize a problem of interest beyond the limits of modern classical simulation, is one way to harness a quantum advantage without a universal quantum computer. 

Optical lattices are one paradigm of quantum simulators, especially suited to problems in condensed matter, which bears closer and closer resemblance to high-energy physics if you go deep enough into the theoretical rabbit hole. In brief, optical lattices synthesize controllable potentials by creating standing waves with intersecting laser beams, corralling the atoms by virtue of the aforementioned dipole force. At high intensities these lattices force atoms to localize much like electrons bound in crystal lattices, but completely free of defects or coupling to lattice phonons. The state of the art has realized single-site readout, population, potential, and spin engineering. In addition to fine control over the vertex terms of engineered Hamiltionians, labs around the world have developed artificial gauge fields by creating virtual flux quanta through the plaquettes of the lattice, forcing neutral atoms to simulate charged particles in synthetic fields with strength exceeding those presently realizable with actual magnets. But in all of this, the poor old momentum operator is barely mentioned at all. Given that an entire research industry is build upon in-situ detection and control in optical lattices, the prospects of metastable helium for detailed study of lattice reciprocal space promises to usher in new insights into condensed matter phenomena.

The first stage of lattice development is the realization of the bose-hubbard model, a simple Hamiltonian that describes bosons interacting with some characteristic strength U, and tunnelling with some rate J, whose relative importance depends on the lattice depth as determined by the intensity of the lattice beams. At low depths, the tunnelling term dominates the hamiltonian, the atoms delocalize in a superfluid phase characterized by a gapless spectrum and long-range phase coherence. For strong lattices, tunnelling through between sites is suppressed and interactions dominate, creating a gapped spectrum in the so-called Mott insulating phase. This is the foundation on which further capabilities can be built. 

We're not there yet. In the meantime, here are some happy snaps from the building process - the time we played Lego with a couple hunded kilos of precision-machined steel in the assembly of our new vacuum chamber, the first iteration of the magnetic trap with big chunky magnetic coils around the optical insertion windows, and following the upgrade to in-vacuum coils with an external bias and super-sciencey bright green coolant lines. This is an absorption image taken of the cloud held in a magnetic trap, where brightness shows the density of the atomic cloud, ready for evaporative cooling. There's some optimization left before we have another BEC in the family, so... watch this space.

## Conclusion


As I said, we're a strongly collaborative group. Externally, Piotr Deuar has provided great support on the depletion project, Gordon Drake and Li-Yan Tan made our tuneout measurement possible, and Chris Vale lent us the laser we've been flogging for the last twelve months, even sending their postdoc Carlos along for some of the three months it took us to get the damn thing aligned. Thanks to our indispensable technicians Ross and Colin, we have an experiment in the first place, and thanks to the technical and moral support of my supervisors and fellow students, none of this would have happened. And, of course, thanks to all of you, my captive audience, for your attention.
