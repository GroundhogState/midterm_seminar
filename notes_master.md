## Overall context: QED and the proton radius problem
	Increasing precision of spectroscopic measurements of Helium are pushing the limits required to test fundamental theories of physics and determine physical constants. 
	Namely, the 2^3P1-2^3P2 transition to 25kHz determines the fine structure to parts-per-billion and the 2^3P-2^3S to 1.4kHz, which can determine the nuclear charge radius to below .1#, better than muonic helium Lamb shift. (Wienczek et al) In the former case, the bottleneck is that theory is not sufficiently developed!
	Further, measured transitions involving 3D states do not agree well with theory ()
	Patkos et al: Measured 2^3s-2^3P and 2^3S-2^1S transitions give different isotope shifts, which give disparate predictions for the nuclear charge radii in He3 and He4. This theory paper corroborates this, and demands further investigation.
	"The main significance of your work will likely be a determination of the absolute ionization energy of the 3 3S and 5 3S states to a sub-MHz accuracy where the theoretical uncertainties are much larger due to the QED terms." - Drake, email
	Other relevant work includes Wim Vassen's measurement of the 1557nm forbidden transition with a frequency comb
